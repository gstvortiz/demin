# Demin
Demin presents helpful functions for data analysis in the field of Mining Engineering. It leverages the resources of widely recognized data science libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

## Instalation (Google Colaboratory):
To integrate Demin into your Google Colaboratory environment, use the following pip command:
```
!pip install demin
```

To ensure you have the latest version:
```
!pip install --upgrade demin
```

## How to import (Google Colaboratory):
Once installed, importing Demin is straightforward. Use the following Python code in your Google Colaboratory notebook:
```
import demin as dm
```

## History
Demin emerged from an idea during my internship in Data Science at the Department of Mining Engineering (DEMIN) at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). As data science is still an underexplored resource in this field, Demin proposes to bring functions that are easy to understand and can assist in common tasks related to geometallurgical data analysis. In this early stage of development, many functions are yet to be added and tested. Consequently, comprehensive documentation will not be available until version 1.0.0.
